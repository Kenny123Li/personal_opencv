"Required leaf false alarm rate achieved. Branch training terminated."
-this means that given the samples and settings of the training, the cascade has reached desired
potential

-by default, minHitRate is 0.995 (idk) and maxFalseAlarmRate is 0.5 (random guessing)

-whereas each stage needs to reach a individual false acceptance rate (good 
classification of negatives) that is a bit better than random guessing, symbolized by 0.5 value
and it only allows 5 out of 1000 positive samples to get wrongly classified during training process
